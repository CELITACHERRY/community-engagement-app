# Product Strategy – Community Engagement App

## Vision
Empowering nonprofits to strengthen parent, volunteer, and donor engagement through simple, AI-powered tools.  
The app will serve as a bridge between organizations and their communities by making communication clearer, reducing staff burnout, and increasing participation.

## Who Are We Serving?
- **Parents & Families** → want clear, timely updates about school and community events.  
- **Volunteers** → need easy access to opportunities and reminders.  
- **Nonprofit Staff & Leaders** → want to save time on repetitive communication and track engagement impact.  
- **Donors/Supporters (Future Phase)** → need transparency into how their contributions create impact.

## What Problem Are We Solving?
- Parents miss important updates or get overwhelmed by scattered channels (email, flyers, texts).  
- Staff and volunteers waste hours repeating the same answers.  
- Nonprofits lack data to measure real community engagement.  
- Engagement and participation are inconsistent, leading to weaker outcomes.

## How Will We Measure Success?
- 📈 **Engagement Rate**: % of messages received & opened/responded.  
- 🎟️ **Event Participation**: attendance growth at community/school events.  
- 🙋🏾 **Volunteer Retention**: repeat volunteers per season/year.  
- ⏱️ **Staff Time Saved**: reduced hours spent on repetitive communication.  
- 🌍 **Community Feedback**: survey responses showing “I feel more informed and connected.”

## Strategic Priorities (Phase 1)
1. Deliver a simple **FAQ Chatbot MVP** to answer common parent/community questions.  
2. Document product requirements in a **PRD** for clarity and scalability.  
3. Establish a foundation for **multi-tenant scalability** (so future nonprofits can each have their own “space”).  
4. Share the build journey publicly to attract nonprofit partners and consulting opportunities.

## Alignment With Nonprofit Mission
- **Accessibility** → Affordable, easy-to-use, low-tech barrier.  
- **Transparency** → Builds trust by surfacing data on engagement.  
- **Empowerment** → Gives communities a voice through two-way communication.
