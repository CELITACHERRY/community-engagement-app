# community-engagement-app
An open-source community engagement app for nonprofits. Built with Glide, Airtable, n8n, and AI to help organizations grow smarter, not harder.

# 🌍 Community Engagement App for Nonprofits

**Vision:** Empowering nonprofits to strengthen parent, volunteer, and donor engagement through simple, AI-powered tools.  

## 🚀 Why This Project
Nonprofits are the backbone of our communities, but they often lack modern tools to:  
- Communicate effectively with parents and community members  
- Track engagement and participation  
- Save staff and volunteers from burnout caused by manual tasks  

This app is my solution: a lightweight, AI-driven engagement platform designed specifically for **mission-driven organizations**.  

## 🎯 Goals
- Improve **parent & community engagement** for schools and nonprofits  
- Simplify **communication & event updates**  
- Provide **data-driven insights** into community participation  
- Make AI accessible to organizations with limited budgets & resources  

## 📌 MVP Features (Phase 1–3)
1. **FAQ Chatbot** – AI-powered answers to common parent/community questions  
2. **Meeting Auto-Summarizer** – Turn long meeting notes into short, clear recaps  
3. **Engagement Dashboard** – Track participation, attendance, and volunteer activity  

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Increase in event participation  
- Higher volunteer retention  
- Reduced admin hours for staff  
- More parents/community members reporting they feel “informed and connected”  

## 🛠 Tech & Tools
- **Frontend/Prototype:** Glide / Figma / React (exploring options)
